# Pave

An easy-to-use Minecraft server template with Docker, complete with a proxy configuration.

## Running the server

To run the server, you will need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) 24.0 or later
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) 3

After ensuring that you have all the prerequisites, run the following commands:

```sh

```

Your server is now up at port 25565. Good job! üòÄüëç
